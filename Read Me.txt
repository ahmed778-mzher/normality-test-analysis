# Normality Test and Histogram Analysis

This project performs a **Shapiro-Wilk test** to check if a given dataset follows a normal distribution. It also visualizes the data distribution with a **histogram** and overlays a **normal distribution curve**.

## Description

This script helps in performing a **normality test** using the **Shapiro-Wilk test** and visualizing the data distribution. It is particularly useful for statistical analysis where it is important to check whether data follow a normal distribution. The project includes:
- **Shapiro-Wilk normality test** to check normality.
- A **histogram** to visualize the data distribution.
- A **normal distribution curve** overlay to compare the data distribution to a theoretical normal distribution.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`: For handling data.
- `scipy`: For statistical tests (Shapiro-Wilk test).
- `matplotlib`: For plotting the histogram and normal distribution curve.

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install pandas scipy matplotlib
